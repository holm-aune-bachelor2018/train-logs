This repository is a part of TDAT3001 Bachelor Thesis in Computer Engineering at NTNU, project number 61:

"End-to-end speech recognition with recurrent neural networks and connectionist temporal classification" by Anita Kristine Aune and Marit Sundet-Holm, 2018.

This repository contains the result- and log files, as well as the trained models from https://github.com/holm-aune-bachelor2018/ctc


Each trained model has its own folder containing:
- Output log generated during training 
- CSV file with results (WER, loss, validation loss)
- Output log from a predict run
- Model as .h5 file
